# A Web Interface for arXiv articles

## Overview

## Background and Motivation
ArXiv is a collaboratively funded, community-supported resource founded by Paul Ginsparg in 1991 and maintained and operated by Cornell University [1]. They promote open science collaboration and progress by providing tools and contents for scientists all over the world. Our hope is to use the rich dataset of scholary articles and powerfull machine learning techniques to discover insights about scietific works, and to build simple tools and explore the dataset for trend analysis, paper recommender engines, category prediction, and more.

## Goals
To build a multi-label multiclass classification model capable of automatic tagging of summaries of articles, generating titles for the summaries, and reccommending similar articles to the user.

## Datasets
Dataset used in this project is the a [metadata file of the arXiv dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv) provided for the Kaggle classification and title genertion challenges. This dataset contains 1.7M+ scholarly papers across STEM, with relevant features such as article titles, authors, categories, abstracts, and more.
